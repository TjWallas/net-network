Dumps of two production servers, running ufw.

The administrators of the firewall wish to remain anonymous. For these reasonsn, we replaced ip addresses with addresses of the TUM and some non-privileged (> 1023) TCP port numbers by random numbers (> 1023).
The port 3306 (mysql) was not changed.


Thank you very much anonymous adminstrator!
