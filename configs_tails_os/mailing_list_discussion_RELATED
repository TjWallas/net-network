Hi,

After talking with a new friend about netfilter and the kernel, we
discussed a funny thing that happens to lots of people who use
iptables. As a result, I took a look at Tails and sure enough, that
funny little issue is present. I think as a result, we should make a
reasonable, minimal change to our iptables rules. Looking at Ferm, the
firewall rules say something that is extremely common which is as
follows for INPUT and OUTPUT:

            mod state state (RELATED ESTABLISHED) ACCEPT;

I propose that we change the rule to be:

            mod state state (NEW ESTABLISHED) ACCEPT;

The reason is pretty simple - RELATED makes the kernel do a lot of
extra lifting that is not needed by using the conntrack kernel code:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/netfilter?id=refs/tags/v3.18-rc7

Take a look at the various nf_conntrack_*.c files to see the various
parsers that are exposed by using the RELATED connection tracking
state. We should never need the kernel to automatically modify the
firewall - as an example, we do not need it to setup an incoming FTP
session based on the kernel believing that we've tried to do an
outgoing FTP session. An old example of this kind of trick is
demonstrated here:

  http://www.securiteam.com/unixfocus/5DP0B2040S.html

An example of how RELATED opens up the firewall is written here:

  https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/

Now, I think that the older exploit above is not functional but I
admit, I haven't tested it or thought about how it may be extended for
the current kernel. That however doesn't convince me that we should
ever have that code exposed on a deployed Tails system. Unless RELATED
literally does nothing, I think it adds attack surface - how much is
an open research question. On the other hand, if RELATED does nothing,
we should remove it, it isn't needed as far as I see.

There are two basic issues that fell out of the discussion today: one
where an incoming connection is allowed, another where the parser has
a bug which is exploitable. Neither is required for our uses, right?
Both are actually harmful to our use cases, I think.

Some of the modules are written by very talented programmers and I'm
sure they're well written. Still, if you look at the code, you'll see
that they literally do IRC or Amanda parsing in the kernel. Here are
some examples:

Amanda:  https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_amanda.c?id=refs/tags/v3.18-rc7

pptp: https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_pptp.c?id=refs/tags/v3.18-rc7

If we look at on the latest Tails, we'll see
/proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper is set to 1. I propose
that we set it to 0. We do not want help tracking connections, we do
not want those extra protocol parsers in the kernel doing this kind of
heavy lifting.

Thus with two minor changes, I think we can easily tighten the system
and it should not impact anything except for an attacker. I think we
want to set the sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_helper to 0 and
remove RELATED from the Ferm configuration. I think we need to replace
it with NEW and nothing else.

We'll need to research exactly what other changes to Ferm need to made
for establishing a connection but I think it is simply (NEW
ESTABLISHED).

It seems that we should really look into tightening the network stack
down to the absolute minimum amount of code. I think right now, the
attack surface is larger than needed for our uses.

Thoughts?

All the best,
Jake

Sure - happy to help. :)

I've not tested it - I was hoping that someone might explain how
RELATED was inserted into the rules in the first place. Who reasoned
about it? Does anyone feel that I'm off base?

I'm happy to help once we know the direction. It isn't clear to me
that this is interesting or useful. In general, I'm happy to do all
four once we've had a bit of a discussion. I feel like I need a sanity
check for my previous email. I may be totally offbase or onto a topic
that makes some sense. I'm actually not completely sure.

All the best,
Jake
