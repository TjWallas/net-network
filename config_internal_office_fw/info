Internal firewall of an office network. There exists an upstream firewall (not shown).
[some cursing about IPsec in iptables omitted]

VLANs:

br0v100 -> standard network (things for everything without a home)

br0v700 -> standard network for things without a home but without a public address (might be NATed)
br0v701 -> ?
br0v702 -> stuff but more complicated and related to virtualization (cloud?)

br0v502 -> Probably things such as PXE boot
