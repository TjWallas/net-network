./ITVal -f ../path/to/output/of/"iptables -L -n" -q doc/Examples/Classes.fw

If ITVal is installed globally (which I do not recommend), it will not run and abort with the following error message:
"error while loading shared libraries: libFDDL.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
This can be fixed by adding "LD_PRELOAD=./FDDL/.libs/libFDDL.so.0" to the front of the command.
However, as shown in the command in the first line: Don't install ITVal globally; call it from the directory where it was compiled.

Compiling with more debug output (easiest way):
Open the Makefile, go to line 134 (on my system\textsuperscript{TM}), starting with "DEFS =".
Add "-DDEBUG -DASSERT_DEBUG -DRANGE_DEBUG".
